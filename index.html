                          Git, for all means and purposes, is a repository managing software. With special features like branches and
                          version control, Git allows users to share and manage their repositories in a dynamic way. Before getting
                          into the special extra features, however, it is important to understand what exactly git repositories are.

                          A repository is simply a folder connected to Git. Unlike a standard file folder, however, its connection to
                          Git allows for those special features I mentioned. Repositories can also be shared easily with others for
                          collaboration and groupwork.<br /><br />To convert a normal folder into a Git repository, a .git folder
                          needs to be added. This folder stores the many functions that give repositories their functionality.
                          Commands like “git init” automatically do this.

                          There are two different types of repositories, though they are strongly connected in many ways: local and
                          remote. Local repositories are those that exist directly on your device. This can be accomplished by
                          downloading one online, cloning one from GitHub, or even just by creating one locally and adding a .git
                          folder.<br /><br />Remote repositories, however, are hosted online by websites like GitHub. Local
                          repositories can be pushed to remote repositories, and vice versa. This adds to the shareability of Git
                          repositories, as they can easily be accessed online or locally.

                            ><br />As previously mentioned, one of Git’s most powerful features is Version Control. Imagine that you
                            are working on a serious coding project with a partner. You two finish up all your edits and updates and
                            decide to make sure it is working one last time. Upon running it, you discover an alarming number of
                            errors and bugs in your code. Having worked on it for such long period of time without checking it, you
                            and your partner have no clue what has caused it and are forced to check almost every section of code for
                            possible problems.</span

                                ><br />Working on large projects can be challenging, especially while working with others who may
                                accomplish tasks differently or hold different perspectives. Version Control exists to ease this process
                                as much as possibly by storing project changes over time. Version Control also, as the name implies,
                                allows separate versions of projects to exist at once. This allows safe testing for bugs or special
                                features without the risk of ruining entire systems.<br /><br />If the goal of a project changes suddenly,
                                programmers can easily access an earlier version of their work and make changes from there. They can then
                                create separate versions of that same project to ensure that all their work is saved.</span

                      One major purpose for Git Branches in Software and Web Development is the isolation of features. Instead of
                      lumping all project features together in one branch, Developers may create a new feature in a new branch.
                      Once a feature is determined necessary for the project, it can then be merged back into the original branch.
                      Branch merging allows different branches to converge together once again.

                    Branches are the technical term for the separate versions that Version Control can create. They can be created
                    at any moment a project change is committed to the repository. While originating from the same initial commit,
                    or first version of a project, branches can end up wildly different from one another.
